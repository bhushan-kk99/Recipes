# Meat Kheema Paratha 

## ingredients  
* 3 cups whole-wheat flour
* 1 cup water, approximately
* 2 cups masala kheema
* 2 tablespoons ghee, or more as needed 

## steps
1. Gather the ingredients.  
2. Place flour in a clean surface.
3. Adding just a little water at a time, knead the whole-wheat flour into a smooth, medium-soft dough. It is likely that you will not need the full cup of water. 
4. Place the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a clean towel, and set aside for 1 hour.
5. In the meantime, prepare the masala kheema according to the recipe or allow your leftovers to reach room temperature.
6. Divide the dough into equally sized balls, about the size of a golf ball.  
7. Lightly flour a clean surface and roll each ball out into a circle that is about 3 inches in diameter.
8. Place approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons of the masala kheema in the center of the dough and fold the edges over to cover the filling completely. Gently press to seal.
9. Roll the dough out into a circle of 7 to 8 inches in diameter. For convenience sake, roll out as many parathas as you like. Stack them with a layer of cling film between each paratha so they're ready to cook.
10. Heat a griddle and place one paratha on it.
11. When you see tiny bubbles rise to the surface, flip it over.
12. Immediately after the first flip, about 3/4 teaspoon ghee on the top of the paratha and spread it all over the surface.
13. Fry for 30 seconds and flip again. Drizzle ghee on this side as well.
14. Flip once again to fry the other side. The paratha is done when both sides are crispy and golden brown.
15. Continue these steps until all of your kheema parathas are cooked.
